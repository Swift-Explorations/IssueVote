<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A single-view applications that enables the user to vote "Yes" or "No" on the specified ballot issue language. The person conducting the election can check the current vote tally and will get the election results when the election is over.

Background 👩🏼‍🎓 🧑🏿‍🎓 👨🏽‍🎓 👩🏻‍💻 👨🏾‍💻

This project works best when you and your students have finished Apple's Develop in Swift Explorations course. Alternatively, I think this project can be done after you and your students have worked through Lesson 3.5: Enumerations in Apple's Develop in Swift Fundamentals course. I created and use this app as a way to reinforce the concepts taught in Apple's Develop in Swift Explorations course and to enable my students to earn points towards their [Business Professionals of America Torch Award](https://bpa.org/torch-awards/) in the Citizenship area. I am really pleased with how this project turned out. My students enjoyed building this and we all learned much from creating this app.

This project also gives me yet another opportunity to teach versioning, software iteration, and the software development process. 

Purpose 🖥 💻 📱

The general purpose of this project is to review and practice the skills learned in Apple's Develop in Swift Explorations course with emphasis on enumerations, switch statements, and creating a UI for a single-screen app. Additionally, this project provides me another chance to teach my students to the process of software improvement and iteration by taking some software they created and adding functionality to it. In doing this I am also able to reinforce the concepts of software versioning and using GitHub for software creation, versioning, and the proper (and safe) way to iterate on software using branching and merging. If you are going to do this project individually or with your students, you will have to have access to Mac hardware and, just as important, Apple first-party software such as Keynote, Preview, and Pages.

Process 👩🏾‍🏫 👨🏻‍🏫 👨🏻‍💻 👩🏽‍💻

The general process and flow of this project is in the format of an Apple Teacher Portfolio lesson. There are three parts/phases to the lesson

**Activate**

**Explore**

**Apply**

You can learn more about and sign up for Apple Teacher here: [Apple Teacher](https://education.apple.com/auth/sign-in).

_Activate_

We want our students to activate any prior knowledge on the topic. Since the students have previously made the Hello app, they will all have the starting point of the project. However, the goal of the project is to greatly improve the app and add more advanced iOS features. As a starting point, students should have a resumé made when this part is complete. Here is the activity I use with my students:

The Ballot Initiative lesson can be found in this repository. It is based upon voting in Ohio. You can modify the .docx file in this repository if necessary or so desired.

_Explore_

Students should have previously learned about enumerations from the Enums and Switch lesson in Unit 3: Organizing Data Unit in Apple's Develop in Swift Explorations course.

Student will now create a ballot initiative playground that will count the number of yes and no votes stored in an array. 

<ol>
  <li>Start with building the playground to count them votes using a for-in loop from an array of String values.
    <li>Comment out the array of Strings and the for-in loop.</li>
    <li>Write an enum with support and oppose values.</li>
    <li>Add values to the array from the enum emphasizing type safety because of using an enum.</li>
      <li>Re-write the for-in loop to use the enum values.</li>
</ol>

A completed version of the playground that I use in my teaching can be found in this repository.

_Apply_

In this part of the project we build the app. The teaching steps are labeled above each part of the app in the VotingState and ViewController files. The detailed explanation of each step can be found at the bottom of the ViewController file.

I hope you enjoy building the app as much as my students and I did. 😊🥳
